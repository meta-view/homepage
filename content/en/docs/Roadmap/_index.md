  The Roadmap of this project.

{{% pageinfo %}}
This project tries to cover a wide area. We have a vision how things should work in the near future, but the how and when is somehow vague.
Hence we decided to go with the following roadmap approach.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

## Platform

As you might already know, the application itself is only delivered as a docker image. The reason for that, is the very easy function to update your location version.  
The final plan is - of course - to create Desktop Grade Applications for the 3 common platforms Windows, Mac and Linux.  
This will be done, if a working update solution was implemented.

## Todo

* creating a basic Application: ✅
* creating a basic abstraction for plugins: ✅
* creating Desktop Apps for Mac/Linux/Windows: ❌
* adding a wizard for step by step import of user data: ❌
* Creating analysis function (time-based, geographical, structural): ❌
* … (feel free to leave an idea in the issues)
