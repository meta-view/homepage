### Why you should care about your data

The history of this project is already quite long. I first started this project with the goal to have one global address book of all my contacts, to be able to see where a contact has an account and also do display different connections between them.
This started way-back when ICQ still was a thing.
At that time my skillset was unfortunetally no up to the task, so the whole project went dormant for some years.

In the meantime Apple proclaimed the [Cloud as the new DataHub](https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/06/icloud-digital-hub/) and whole ecosystems migrated from stand-alone local data to cloud-based data stores.

So every bigger company since then offers `cloud storage`, pictures, messages, contacts - your memories are stored somewhere on a remote Computer, with access as long as the provider is able to provide it.
If a provider goes down (see the current troubles Flickr has), or is limited by gouverments to provide these services (Trump's social network bill), your personal data is lost.  
So the truth is, that the don't have the control over your data anymore.
In theory it should be possible to have a local copy of your data somewhere, but in practise no service provider has any interest in providing you this tooling.

So after years of sleep and after I was able to add some more tricks to my toolset and the fact, that data privacy discussion are on a all time high, I decided to re-active this project.

My name is Philipp, I am a Software Engineer, living in Germany. I am always eager to find elegant solutions for existing problems, so this project is a perfect opportunity :-).  
I think that most situations only exist out of convenience. You really never know, what happen if you do things differently if you don't at least try.  

I have a strong background in Java and Go, but I am also able to deliver appealing UIs.
Additionaly I will also try to steer the overall system design and project organisation.

If you have further questions or just want to Ping me, you can contact me on twitter [@phaus](https://twitter.com/phaus).
